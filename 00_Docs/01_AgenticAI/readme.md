## 🧠 The 5 Levels of AGI (Modern Framework)

| Level           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Chatbots**     | Basic agents that engage in conversations. Limited reasoning or memory. Examples: ChatGPT, Alexa |
| **2. Reasoners**    | Can analyze data, make logical decisions, and break down problems. |
| **3. Agents**       | Autonomous entities that plan tasks, execute actions, and use tools with minimal human input. |
| **4. Innovators**   | AI systems capable of creating new ideas, content, or strategies. Go beyond pre-learned knowledge. |
| **5. Organizations**| Groups of AI agents that operate collaboratively like a virtual organization or company. |

## ⚙️ Generative AI
- **Definition:** AI that can create original content including text, images, video, music, and code.
- **Examples:** ChatGPT, DALL·E, Sora, Midjourney

## 💬 Chatbots
- **Definition:** Conversational interfaces built on rule-based logic or AI models.
- **Types:** Rule-based, AI-powered
- **Use Cases:** Customer support, virtual assistants, information bots

## 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Definition:** Foundation models trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human language.
- **Examples:** GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- **Capabilities:** Text generation, Q&A, translation, summarization, coding

## 🚀 What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that act as **autonomous agents**. They don’t just respond to prompts but **think, plan, take action, use tools, and reflect** to complete complex, multi-step goals.

### 🧩 Key Characteristics:
- **Autonomy** – Acts independently without step-by-step human guidance
- **Planning** – Breaks down goals into sub-tasks
- **Tool Use** – Can use APIs, search, calculators, plugins
- **Memory** – Retains knowledge across sessions
- **Reflection** – Self-assesses and improves its actions
- **Collaboration** – Can work with other agents or humans
