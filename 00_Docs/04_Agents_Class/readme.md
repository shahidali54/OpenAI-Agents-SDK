# 🧠 Agent Class: Behind-the-Scenes Workflow

This document explains how the **Agent Class** works internally based on the provided flowchart. It breaks down each step that occurs when a user interacts with the agent system.

---

## 🔷 1. Agent Initialization

The Agent is set up with the following components:

- **Name**: Identifier for the agent.
- **Instructions**: How the agent should behave.
- **Model**: The LLM model used (e.g., GPT).
- **Tools**: Tools the agent can access (e.g., web search, calculator).
- **Handoffs**: Rules for delegating tasks to sub-agents.
- **Guardrails**: Safety and ethical rules.
- **Context**: Memory or history from past user interactions.

---


## 🔷 2. User Input

- The user sends a message.
- This input is combined with the agent's instructions and memory.

---

## 🔷 3. Prompt Creation

- The system combines:
  - User input
  - Agent instructions
  - Any existing context  
- → A **prompt** is created and sent to the LLM.

---

## 🔷 4. LLM Generates Output

- The LLM processes the prompt.
- It decides whether it needs to:
  - **Call a tool**, or
  - **Handle the request directly**

---

## 🔁 Decision Branches

### ✅ A. If a Tool Call is Needed

1. The tool is **executed**.
2. The **result** is returned to the agent.

### 🔄 B. If No Tool is Called

- The system checks whether to **handoff** the task:
  - **Yes**:
    - The task is **delegated** to a sub-agent.
    - The sub-agent **handles the task**.
    - The result is **returned to the main agent**.
  - **No**:
    - The main agent continues handling the task.

---

## 🔷 5. Final Output

- Once the task is complete:
  - The agent prepares the **final response**.

---

## 🔷 6. Output Customization & Monitoring

Before the response is returned to the user:

- Apply any **customizations** (temperature, tokens, etc.)
- **Trace and monitor** the workflow for system tracking.

---

## 🔷 7. Response Returned to User

- The **final response** is sent back to the user.

---

## 📌 Summary

The **Agent Class** serves as an intelligent system that:

1. Accepts user input.
2. Builds a context-aware prompt.
3. Calls tools or sub-agents if needed.
4. Generates a response.
5. Applies monitoring and customization.
6. Returns a final polished result to the user.
