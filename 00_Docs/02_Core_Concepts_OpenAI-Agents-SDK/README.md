# OpenAI Agents SDK - README

## Overview
The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a production-ready framework for building and managing intelligent, autonomous AI agents. It evolves from the experimental **Swarm** framework, incorporating structured workflows, safety guardrails, and enhanced observability. The SDK supports Anthropic's design patterns for efficient multi-agent systems, enabling developers to create scalable and controlled AI solutions.

## Core Concepts
The OpenAI Agents SDK is built around four key concepts:

1. **Agents**  
   - **Purpose**: The intelligent core that handles reasoning, decision-making, and planning.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Understands user goals.  
     - Performs multi-step reasoning.  
     - Utilizes tools and memory to execute tasks.  
   - **Example**: An agent can debug Python code by planning steps, selecting tools, and providing feedback.

2. **Hands-off Execution**  
   - **Purpose**: Automates task execution without manual intervention.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Fully autonomous task handling.  
     - Agents select tools and steps independently.  
   - **Example**: Booking a flight by searching, comparing prices, and confirming autonomously.

3. **Guardrails**  
   - **Purpose**: Ensures safe and controlled agent behavior.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Restricts access to tools, files, or outputs.  
     - Validates inputs and outputs for correctness.  
   - **Example**: Prevents an agent from sending unauthorized emails.

4. **Tracing & Observability**  
   - **Purpose**: Tracks and logs agent actions for debugging and transparency.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Step-by-step logs of actions, tool calls, and reasoning.  
     - Session-level monitoring.  
   - **Example**: Tracks an agent's workflow from searching Wikipedia to summarizing content.

## Swarm - The Precursor
- **What is Swarm?**  
  Swarm was an experimental framework by OpenAI for orchestrating multi-agent systems. It introduced:  
  - **Agents**: Independent units for specific tasks.  
  - **Handoffs**: Mechanisms to transfer control between agents.  
  - **Design Philosophy**: Lightweight and flexible orchestration for testing.

- **Relation to Agents SDK**:  
  The Agents SDK is a refined, production-ready evolution of Swarm, adding robust guardrails, tracing, and structured workflows.

## Anthropic Design Patterns
The SDK aligns with Anthropic's design patterns for multi-agent systems:

1. **Prompt Chaining**: Breaks complex tasks into sequential steps, with agents handling each step.  
2. **Routing**: Directs tasks to specialized agents via handoffs.  
3. **Parallelization**: Runs multiple agents concurrently for efficiency.  
4. **Orchestrator-Workers**: A central agent delegates subtasks to worker agents.  
5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Uses guardrails as evaluators to enforce correctness and improve performance.

## Getting Started
To start using the OpenAI Agents SDK:
1. Define your agents and their goals.
2. Set up tools and memory for task execution.
3. Configure guardrails to ensure safe operations.
4. Use tracing to monitor and debug agent workflows.
