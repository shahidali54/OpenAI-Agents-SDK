"""# 2. Using Generics
------------------

Generics let you create functions, methods, or classes that can work with multiple types while preserving type relationships. Generics:

- Better communicate the intent of your code.
- Allow static type checking to verify correctness.

In Python, this is done using TypeVar.

üîπ Using TypeVar
First, import TypeVar and define a generic type variable T:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")  # T represents a generic type
```

- `T` is a placeholder that can be **replaced with any type** when the function is called.
- The **actual type is inferred at runtime**.
"""


nums = [1, 2, 3]
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Analogy -> Think of T as fill in the Blank
# -> using T is community driven practice.
T = TypeVar('T')

def generic_first_element(items: list[T]) -> T:
    return items[0]

num_result = generic_first_element(nums)        # type inferred as int
string_result = generic_first_element(strings)  # type inferred as str

print(num_result)    # 1
print(string_result) # 'a'

"""#### Why Use Generics When Python Lets You Pass Any List?

Explanation: By using Generics, Python can infer and enforce types at compile-time, enhancing clarity and safety.

1. **Static Type Checking**  
   - **Without generics**, you can pass any list, but static type checkers (like [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)) cannot verify that your function is used correctly. For instance, if your function is meant to handle only strings but you accidentally pass a list of integers, Python won't complain until (or unless) something goes wrong at runtime.  
   - **With generics**, you declare something like `List[str]` or `List[int]`, and a type checker will immediately flag if you pass the wrong type. This early feedback catches type errors before they become runtime bugs.

2. **Code Clarity and Intent**  
   - Generics communicate clearly to other developers (and future you) that `first_element(items: List[T]) -> T` is intended to work with a list of a single, consistent type `T`.  
   - When you see `List[str]`, there is no ambiguity about what the list is supposed to contain. This helps prevent accidental mixing of data types.

3. **Improved Tooling Support**  
   - Modern IDEs can use your generic annotations to provide better **autocompletion, refactoring,** and **linting** suggestions.  
   - For example, if a function returns `T`, your IDE will automatically know the returned type is `str` for a `List[str]`, saving time when using the result elsewhere in your code.

4. **Future-Proofing**  
   - As projects grow more complex and data structures become nested, generics help keep track of types. This is especially crucial in large-scale applications like **production AI systems**, where data consistency and correctness are paramount.

5. **Avoiding Silent Logic Errors**  
   - Without generics, a developer could pass any list, perhaps by mistake. You might not catch it until it causes a subtle bug (like a `TypeError` in production).  
   - By declaring generic types, the mismatch is caught early, which often saves hours of debugging.

---

In short, Python‚Äôs flexibility of ‚Äúpass any list‚Äù is convenient for small scripts or quick prototypes. However, in larger, more complex, or production-grade systems‚Äîespecially with AI or data-heavy workflows‚Äîgenerics, combined with type checkers, dramatically improve reliability, clarity, and maintainability.

Generics can also be used with classes.
