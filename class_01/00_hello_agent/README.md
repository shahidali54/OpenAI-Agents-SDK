# OpenAI Agents SDK

Welcome to my learning repository on the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my learning and exploration of the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. As an aspiring developer and AI enthusiast, I am currently studying how to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents using OpenAI's new tools. This SDK represents a modern, powerful approach to building autonomous systems capable of reasoning, planning, and taking actions via tools (APIs, functions, or code execution).

## 🚀 What is OpenAI Agents SDK?

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** allows developers to build agents that can interact with tools and APIs, enabling powerful multi-step reasoning and automation. It is tightly integrated with OpenAI models and offers a seamless developer experience for building real-world AI assistants and autonomous agents.

### 🔧 Key Features

- **Tool Use:** Agents can call functions, APIs, or external tools.
- **Memory:** Support for memory (context/history) management.
- **Code Interpreter:** Built-in code execution environments.
- **Multi-Turn Reasoning:** Handles complex queries with step-by-step logic.
- **Secure by Design:** Built with safeguards and safety mechanisms.
- **Developer Friendly:** Easy to integrate with Python and existing systems.

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand the architecture of OpenAI Agents.
- Learn how to define tools and integrate them with agents.
- Explore how agents reason, plan, and act.
- Build small projects using the SDK to gain hands-on experience.
- Compare it with LangChain and identify where it excels.

## 🆚 Comparison: OpenAI Agents SDK vs LangChain

| Feature                          | OpenAI Agents SDK                         | LangChain                              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Native OpenAI Model Support      | ✅ Deeply integrated                      | ✅ Good support                         |
| Built-in Tool Calling            | ✅ Out of the box                         | 🔶 Requires setup                      |
| Code Execution Environment       | ✅ Built-in interpreter                   | 🔶 Plugin-dependent                    |
| Simplicity & Developer Experience| ✅ Simple & intuitive                     | 🔶 Can be complex with chaining        |
| Ecosystem                        | ✅ OpenAI ecosystem                       | ✅ Rich third-party tool integration   |
| Memory Handling                  | ✅ Native memory support                  | ✅ Custom memory options available     |
| Customization                    | 🔶 Less flexible (for now)               | ✅ Highly customizable                 |

### 📝 Summary

- **OpenAI Agents SDK** is ideal for quickly building production-ready AI agents with tight OpenAI integration, especially for OpenAI API users.
- **LangChain** is more flexible for complex, multi-model, or multi-provider setups, but can be more complicated to set up and manage.
