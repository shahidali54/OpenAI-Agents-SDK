# Chainlit Learning

Welcome to my Chainlit learning project!  
This repository is focused on my journey to understand and build AI applications using **Chainlit** â€” an open-source framework to create conversational apps powered by LLMs.

---

## ðŸ“˜ About Chainlit

**Chainlit** is a powerful and developer-friendly framework that helps you rapidly build, debug, and deploy LLM-based applications with a sleek front-end UI â€” ideal for agents, chatbots, assistants, and tool-using models.

It supports:

- Integration with OpenAI, LangChain, and other backends.
- Easy creation of dynamic UIs for AI apps.
- Live updates and debugging.
- Markdown and rich media rendering.

---

## ðŸš€ Why I'm Using Chainlit

I am exploring Chainlit because:

- It provides a beautiful and ready-made UI for testing AI workflows.
- It's perfect for working with **agents** and tool-calling systems like **OpenAI Agents SDK** and **LangChain**.
- It speeds up development and gives visual feedback instantly.

---

## âš¡ Key Features I'm Exploring

- Running AI agents with rich conversation UI.
- Tool usage with feedback in real-time.
- Custom input components (text, sliders, checkboxes).
- Streamed responses for a better user experience.

## ðŸ†š OpenAI Agents SDK + Chainlit = ðŸ”¥

I plan to use **Chainlit** as the front-end interface while using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** as the backend logic for the agents.

| Component            | Purpose                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| OpenAI Agents SDK    | Brain/Logic of the agent         |
| Chainlit             | UI for interaction (chat window) |

This combination allows me to create fully interactive, agent-powered apps using simple Python code and LLM models.

- Chainlit setup files (`chainlit.md`, `main.py`, etc.)
- Agent examples with UI
- Tool examples (file search, calculator, API calls)
- Notes and tips from my learning

## âœ… My Learning Goals

- Understand how Chainlit renders and controls chat UI.
- Build a full-stack LLM-powered assistant.
- Integrate memory, tools, and multi-step reasoning.
- Compare UI experience with and without Chainlit.
